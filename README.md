A conglomeration of many a meme mod sounds, featuring:

- A custom mashup of the TOTEM Remix of Free Bird and the original for the Jester, allowing for a better build-up but with the full-length solo (credit to [atg](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/atg/) for the idea)
- Many meme sounds for the hoarding bug, including the classic "Yippee!" created by [sunnobunno](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sunnobunno/) and the wonderful vocals of the German "Fornite und Cola" kid, plus a few others ;)
- The "bonk" sound effect for the shovel (credit once again to [sunnobunno](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/sunnobunno/) for the idea)
- The "Bad to the Bone" riff for the airhorn (credit to [02](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/02/) for the idea)
- The ear-shattering metal clang sound for when drop large metals things (credit to [PanHouse](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/PanHouse/) for the idea)
